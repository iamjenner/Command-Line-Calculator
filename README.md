Your goal is to add methods to your MyArrayList class to implement the MyStack
interface. Afterwards, you will use your MyArrayList as a stack to implement a
command line calculator. Specifically, you will convert an infix expression to postfix and
then evaluate the postfix expression to produce the value of the mathematical expression.
